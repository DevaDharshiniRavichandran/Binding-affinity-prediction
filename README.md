## Model Structure

The model takes a pair epitope and TCR sequences as input and returns the binding affinity between the two. The sequences are processed through an embedding layer before reaching the multi-head self-attention layer. The outputs of these layers are then concatenated and fed through a linear decoder layer to receive the final binding affinity score.

## Modified Model Architecture:

### Modifications Made:
1. **Incorporation of Additional Activation Functions:**
   - Added a ReLU activation function after one of the linear layers in the decoder to introduce non-linearity and enhance feature learning.
   - Used a Sigmoid activation function at the final output layer to produce a probability score for binary classification.

2. **Enhanced Data Normalization:**
   - Applied normalization to the concatenated embeddings of TCR and epitope sequences before passing them to the decoder.

3. **Custom Loss Function:**
   - Integrated a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function to address class imbalance issues in the training data.

4. **Extended Performance Metrics:**
   - Added evaluation metrics such as Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Cohenâ€™s Kappa to provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance.
